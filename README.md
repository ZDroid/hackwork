# INTRODUCTION

Hi and welcome to **nginZ**.

NginZ is acronym of Engine~Z. It's lightweight web site engine.

What's my idea? Simple engine for web sites with great look/design.

http://zdroid.anapnea.net ===> built with nginZ

# TECHNOLOGIES

Engine~Z is written in HTML5, CSS3 and PHP. Extensions of some files are `.php`, but most of code is HTML (under PHP).
